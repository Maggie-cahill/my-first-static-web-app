						 <p> Glasan student village have no concern for the students at 3,158 I lived in a 4 person building, the kitchen was 
							 something you would see in a mobile home, with not enough space to prepare real food. The fridge and freezer combination
							 with not enough for 4 people needs. seems to use the cheapest materials and workers inside their houses. The windows were
							 not sealed causing mold (no amount of airing would fix) that we are later charged for. As well as sleeping with mold only 
							 the microwave worked properly in the kitchen. But don't worry a lot of money is spent on landscaping the gardens are always

						 <p> I recently booked in with 3 kids and 2 dogs.
							 On arrival we were greeted by another guest from the house nxt door who was very much in our personal space. Went inside and the house was filthy. The smell of stale smoke and the dirt. The garden is not enclosed as it doesn’t state this. Went straight to reception and told the girl im not staying there. She was very apologetic and understanding.
							 I expected just standard decor but as long as it was clean and safe I would be ok. It wasn't clean and didn't feel safe. I had to make the 4 hr journey home again as we couldn’t get any other accommodation with our dogs. Management and staff were very good to deal with, but i had 3 very unhappy children.
							 I would class the accommodation as hostel type as they def are not suitable for families.
							 Students were still on site.</p>

						 <p> Location is good, close to the city, bedrooms are a good size. Grounds are nice and well maintained. Plenty of parking.
							 It wasn't cleaned thoroughly before we arrived. There were groups of students still there in the summer months and were very noisy all through the night, security didn't do anything. Should have at least put the families in a different row of housing to reduce the noise.
							 Beds are not comfortable. Living area is small.
							 If they dealt with the noise issues and cleaned it better it wouldn't be a bad place for what it is, basic accommodation near the city.</p>

							 Four adults and five children stayed in July in six bedroom. Everything in the house you need with regards

							 staff very helpful during our stay and sent an item of mine that I left behind back in the post after our trip. 
							 Nearby shops and takeaways 2 minutes drive. Value for money indeed and we’ll be back!

							<p> Stayed with friends for a few nights. The rooms were spacious but smelled of damp. The kitchen and sitting area were really dirty. 
							   It was as if everything was cleaned with a greasy cloth! The grill hadn't been cleaned out and had the grease and remnants of someones
							   rashers and sausages! the walls were dirty and cupboard doors were sticky. Bring bleach if you are using the kitchen ware, the cups were 
							   all stained! There was absolutely nothing in the line of washing up liquid, a dish cloth, bin bags so make sure you bring your own. We didn't
							   spend much time in the apartment, so it wasn't much of an issue, but I'd have been complaining fairly promptly if I had kids with me. Didn't 
							   seem to be a play area outside for children which is a shame as they have space on a big green area. The smoke alarm was pulled off the sitting 
							   room ceiling...not good. Would I stay again? Probably not. The cleaners need to go back to cleaning school.</p>

						 <p> We have probably never stayed anywhere with so low value for money.
							We thought we had rented an apartment. It is 4 rooms with automatic locks on each, locking when you leave the room. It’s like a prison. You can feel all springs in the madras. The kitchenware was dirty. So we had to wash it up before use. Some of the windows can hardly be closed and are filled with old cobweb.
							For the rest you cannot really say it’s dirty but it’s so worn out that it is difficult to clean. It is really in need of maintenance.
							The linen and towels were clean and the staff very friendly. However, it doesn’t compensate that this place is highly overpriced and not to be recommended.</p>

						 <p> Very nice staff at Reception. We travelled with three teens. It was nice to have an apartment with ensuite bathrooms. The accommodation is 
							basic student accommodation so there is no luxury here. However, we had plenty of space within the apartment. It's about a half hour walk into 
							the city centre and there isn't much in the immediate vicinity so it's a bit short on atmosphere. However, it's great value for a family stay. 
							There is a playground on the campus which would be good for younger children.</p>
